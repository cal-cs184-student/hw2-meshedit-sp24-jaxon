    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The shading process is fascinating. In this project, we implemented code
      for Bézier curves and surfaces and initially used the half-edge data
      structure to calculate vertex normals, half-edge flips, and splits. Since
      the beginning of the semester, I have seen my classmates' rich and
      creative works. Each project has great potential for expansion, depending
      solely on how much time one is willing to invest. Graphics is truly
      wonderful!

    <h3 align="middle">
      Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision
    </h3>

    <h4>Concept</h4>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method. For the input control
      points, points are taken between adjacent control points at a given ratio
      t, and this process is repeated for the new points generated, until only
      one point remains. When adjusting t, the trajectory of this point forms
      the Bézier curve.
    </p>

    <h4>Code Implementation</h4>
    <div>\[p'_i = lerp(p_i, p_{i+1}, t) = (1-t)p_i + t p_{i+1} \]</div>
    <p>
      The code implementation process is very simple. You only need to write a
      loop to continuously calculate and take points for adjacent vertices and
      put them into a vector container. Pay attention to the boundaries.
    </p>

    <h4>My Curve</h4>

    <p>
      By first determining the bounding box, the number of pixels that need to
      be checked is limited. There is no need to compute pixels outside the
      bounding box.

      Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau
    </h3>

    <h4>Concept:</h4>
    <p>
      The process from curve to surface is as follows: first, use De Casteljau's
      algorithm on one parameter direction to calculate the corresponding
      points, then use these control points to calculate the final points in
      another parameter direction.
    </p>

    <h4>Implement</h4>
    <p>
      The implementation process essentially follows the formulas from the
      lecture. First, it is determined that the overall calculation should be
      carried out in the evaluate function, which means the process flows from
      evaluate to evaluate1D to evaluateStep. The content of each part can be
      obtained based on hints from the problem. Therefore, I first find a point
      on the curve at u, then use evaluate1D again to find the final point on
      the surface at (u,v).

    <h4>Debug Pipeline</h4>
    <p>Problem: When trying to run the program, it shows no response.</p>
    <p>
      Solution: I originally thought that my code did not check the boundaries,
      or there was an issue with the exit condition that caused an infinite
      loop. By checking Ed, I learned that I need to use "Release" Build,
      instead of "Debug" Build.

      Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure
    </h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <h4>implement</h4>
    <p>
      The implementation process is actually quite simple, mainly about
      understanding the formulas, that is, how to calculate the vertex normals.
      After becoming familiar with the vertex class, I first write an outer
      loop, which is to traverse each face for this vertex. This requires
      continuously traversing its edges and obtaining the face each edge points
      to, paying attention to check the boundaries. Then, for each face, I
      obtain the positions of the vertices of the three edges through the
      half-edge of the face, so that the vectors of the edges can be calculated.
      Finally, by taking the cross product of these vectors, the normal vector
      can be obtained. Add up the normal vectors according to the area weight,
      and finally normalize to return the unit vertex normal vector.

    <h4>Something Interesting</h4>
    <img src="images/task3-3.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      After I finished writing the code, I found that the results were not the
      same. What's going on? I repeatedly checked Ed and carefully inspected,
      but couldn't find where the problem was. After a long thought, I finally
      realized: It turns out I was still using ./meshedit
      ../../../bez/teapot.bez...
    </p>
    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>

    <p>
      Edge flip is an important local mesh operation. Though it seems easy, the
      implementation requires a lot of pointer reassignments. I began by drawing
      down the mesh before and after the half-edge flip and labeling all the
      elements in the two meshes. There's no element created. But I needed to
      make sure the proper edge gets flipped and others point to the right
      places. Luckily, I did not run into bugs. From the examples below, we can
      see how the mesh topology changes by edge flips.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

    <p>Edge split is another local mesh operation that requires a lot of pointer reassignments. The implementation is similar to an edge flip. But it's more complex in that it involves element creation. Again, I began by drawing down the mesh before and after the manipulation and labeling all the elements. Then according to the drawing, I adjusted the old elements and assigned proper pointer for the new elements. In this step, the code successfully works and no bug is encountered.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

    <p>I implemented the loop subdivision based on the steps recommended by the project specs. I first went through all the vertices and edges. I set all the vertices and edges to old. I then calculated the new positions for the vertices after subdivision and stored them to the new position property of vertices and edges. Then, I looped through all the old edges and slipped them. For the edges that connect old and new vertices, I flipped them. As a result, a triangle on the mesh is now divided into 4 triangles. In the last step, I assigned the new positions I calculated before to the newly created vertices.</p>
      <p>This part took me a lot of time to debug. My first bug came from the wrong data type I used. I was using integers to store new positions and it makes all positions wrong. I then convert all of them to floating points. Then I found out that in the process of subdivision, there were some parts of the mesh that did not get subdivided correctly. This was because I did not label the new elements right. I went back to the edge split part and fixed the code. Lastly, I encountered some seg fault for the second loop of subdivision. This bug was annoying and it took me a lot of time to figure out the problem. It was due to the pointer rearrangement from the edge flips and edge splits. So I went back to the earlier code again and fixed them.</p>
    <br />


    <p>The subdivision will change all the vertices' positions. As a result, the corners and edges will lose their sharpness because of the subdivision algorithm. However, I found out that I can preserve some sharpness but pre-processing the mesh. For example, if I want to keep the sharpness of a corner, I can first split the edges around that corner.</p>
    <p>Another drawback of subdivision is that if the starter mesh is asymmetric, the subdivision will also be asymmetric. I dealt with this by first splitting some edges to make the mesh asymmetric. As a result, the subdivision will also create a symmetric mesh.</p>
